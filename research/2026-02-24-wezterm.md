# WezTerm

## Context

Investigated as a potential replacement for the default WSL terminal (Windows Terminal). The goal is to evaluate whether WezTerm offers a meaningfully better developer experience on WSL2, what setup it requires, and how it compares to alternatives like Windows Terminal and Ghostty.

## Findings

### What Is WezTerm

WezTerm is a GPU-accelerated terminal emulator and multiplexer written in Rust, created by Wez Furlong. It runs natively on Windows, macOS, Linux, and BSD — true cross-platform with one config file. It's designed as a "batteries-included" terminal: built-in multiplexer (tabs, panes, workspaces), SSH client, image rendering, and fully scriptable configuration via Lua.

### Key Features

**GPU Acceleration**
Renders with GPU, supports ligatures, true color, color emoji, and dynamic color schemes. Unlike Windows Terminal's GPU acceleration which is general-purpose, WezTerm's rendering was built from scratch for terminal use cases.

**Built-in Multiplexer**
No tmux or screen required. Native tabs, panes (split horizontally/vertically), multiple windows, and named workspaces. Supports:
- Local multiplexer (single process, zero-latency)
- SSH multiplexer (persistent sessions on remote servers, requires wezterm installed on server)
- Unix domain sockets (WSL integration path)
- TLS domains (encrypted TCP)

**Lua Configuration**
All configuration is in `~/.wezterm.lua` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wezterm/wezterm.lua`). Hot-reloads without restarting. Lua scripting enables:
- Dynamic tab titles
- Custom key tables and workspace switching
- Event hooks
- Programmatic layout and behavior

**Shell Integration**
OSC 7 (working directory tracking), OSC 133 (prompt/command zone marking), and OSC 1337 (user variable passing). When enabled, new tabs/panes spawn in the current directory automatically. Setup: source `wezterm.sh` in `.bashrc` / `.zshrc`.

**Graphics Protocols**
iTerm2 image protocol, Kitty graphics protocol, and experimental Sixel — inline image rendering in the terminal (`imgcat` command). Useful for image previews in tools like yazi, ranger, or custom scripts.

**SSH Client**
Native SSH with tab/pane support. Connect directly to remote hosts: `wezterm ssh user@host`. Doesn't require tmux on the remote server if both sides run wezterm.

**Hyperlinks, Mouse, Selection**
Clickable hyperlinks, SGR mouse reporting (works correctly in vim/tmux), xterm-style text selection, and Quick Select mode for keyboard-driven copy.

### WSL2 Integration

WezTerm has native WSL domain support. It auto-discovers installed WSL distributions and exposes them as named domains. This is the best first-class WSL integration available among terminal emulators.

**Auto-detect all WSL distros:**
```lua
local wezterm = require 'wezterm'
return {
  wsl_domains = wezterm.default_wsl_domains(),
}
```

**Set a specific WSL distro as the default (opens directly into WSL):**
```lua
local wezterm = require 'wezterm'
local config = wezterm.config_builder()

config.default_domain = 'WSL:Ubuntu'  -- or 'WSL:Ubuntu-22.04' etc.
config.font = wezterm.font('JetBrainsMono Nerd Font')
config.font_size = 13

return config
```

**Customize a specific distro's behavior:**
```lua
local wsl_domains = wezterm.default_wsl_domains()
for _, dom in ipairs(wsl_domains) do
  if dom.name == 'WSL:Ubuntu' then
    dom.default_prog = { 'zsh' }
    dom.default_cwd = '~'
  end
end
return { wsl_domains = wsl_domains }
```

When `default_domain` is set to a WSL domain, WezTerm opens directly into Linux. New tabs/panes also open in WSL by default. With shell integration enabled (OSC 7), new panes inherit the current working directory from the active pane.

**Note on Unix socket muxing**: Unix domain multiplexing only works with WSL 1. WSL2 doesn't support AF_UNIX interop, so SSH or WslDomain configs are the correct approach for WSL2.

### Minimal Working Config for WSL2

```lua
-- ~/.wezterm.lua (on Windows: %USERPROFILE%\.wezterm.lua)
local wezterm = require 'wezterm'
local config = wezterm.config_builder()

-- Open directly into WSL Ubuntu (check name with: wsl -l -v)
config.default_domain = 'WSL:Ubuntu'

-- Font
config.font = wezterm.font('JetBrainsMono Nerd Font')
config.font_size = 13

-- Theme
config.color_scheme = 'Tokyo Night'

-- Window chrome
config.window_decorations = 'RESIZE'
config.window_background_opacity = 1.0

-- Scrollback
config.scrollback_lines = 10000

-- Disable annoying confirmation on close
config.window_close_confirmation = 'NeverPrompt'

return config
```

Then in `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` inside WSL, add shell integration:
```bash
# WezTerm shell integration (enables OSC 7 cwd tracking)
if [ -n "$WEZTERM_EXECUTABLE" ]; then
  . /path/to/wezterm.sh
fi
```

Or install the wezterm package inside WSL which includes the shell integration script automatically.

### WezTerm vs Windows Terminal

| Feature | WezTerm | Windows Terminal |
|---|---|---|
| GPU acceleration | Yes (built for it) | Yes (AtlasEngine) |
| Built-in multiplexer | Yes (tabs, panes, workspaces) | Tabs only, no pane splits |
| Config system | Lua (scriptable, hot-reload) | JSON/GUI settings |
| WSL integration | First-class WslDomain | Works but no shell integration |
| Ligature support | Yes | Partial |
| SSH client | Built-in | No |
| Image rendering | iTerm2, Kitty, Sixel | No |
| Cross-platform config | Single `wezterm.lua` everywhere | Windows only |
| Learning curve | High (requires Lua) | Low (GUI settings) |
| Release cadence | Irregular (slower since 2024) | Regular (Microsoft-backed) |
| Installation size | ~200MB (self-contained) | Lightweight |

**Verdict for WSL power users**: WezTerm wins on raw capability — especially the built-in multiplexer (no tmux needed), WSL domain auto-detection, and cross-platform config. Windows Terminal is simpler and more reliably maintained but requires tmux for anything beyond basic tabs.

### WezTerm vs Ghostty

Ghostty is the most hyped new terminal (released 2024, written in Zig). It's faster than WezTerm by 2-5x in benchmarks. However: **Ghostty does not have native Windows support as of early 2026**. Running Ghostty on Windows requires installing it inside WSL2 (building from source or via snap), which is awkward and runs inside the Linux GUI layer rather than as a native Windows app. Native Windows support is planned but no timeline has been committed.

**For WSL2 on Windows: WezTerm is the better choice right now.** Ghostty is a future consideration when Windows support ships.

### WezTerm vs Alacritty

Alacritty is extremely fast and minimal but deliberately excludes tabs and split panes (requires tmux). It also lacks ligature support. WezTerm is the better fit when you want a self-contained experience without coupling to tmux.

---

### Drawbacks and Known Issues

**Lua configuration learning curve**
Any non-trivial customization requires Lua knowledge. There's no GUI settings panel. Copy-pasting configs from the internet may not work as-is, especially on WSL where paths and domains need adjustment.

**Slower development pace since 2024**
WezTerm's maintainer (Wez Furlong, solo project) had reduced activity through 2024-2025 due to a cross-country move. The project hasn't stalled but releases are infrequent. As of December 2024, the maintainer committed to expanding the contributor base. The project is alive but not Microsoft-backed. [GitHub issue #7451](https://github.com/wezterm/wezterm/issues/7451)

**Large binary (~94-226MB)**
Self-contained binary bundles fonts, image libs, SSH support, and shader compilation. Not a concern for a developer workstation but notable.

**Occasional Windows performance issues**
Some users report input lag on Windows (not WSL — the win32 side), particularly in older GPU configurations or VMs. This is less common on modern hardware. GPU acceleration falls back to software rendering if the GPU doesn't support required OpenGL features.

**SSH multiplexing requires matching versions**
For SSH domain multiplexing to work, the same wezterm version must be on both client and server. Not an issue if you're only using WSL domains.

**Memory/CPU accumulation over time**
A reported issue where WezTerm becomes slow after extended use. Workaround: periodic restart. Not universal but worth knowing.

### Summary Recommendation

**Switch from Windows Terminal to WezTerm if:**
- You want a built-in multiplexer (panes + workspaces) without maintaining a tmux config
- You want WSL to be the default — new terminal opens directly into Linux
- You want a single config file that works identically across Windows/Linux/macOS
- You care about ligatures, image rendering, or advanced typography
- You're already comfortable with Lua or are willing to learn it

**Stay on Windows Terminal if:**
- You want zero-config maintenance (Microsoft actively develops it)
- Your WSL usage is casual and tmux isn't part of your workflow
- You prefer a GUI for configuration

**Bottom line**: For a developer doing serious WSL2 work (long sessions, multiple panes, file navigation), WezTerm is materially better. The WSL domain auto-detection, shell integration for cwd tracking, and native multiplexer make daily use noticeably smoother. The Lua config is a one-time investment.

## Open Questions

- Does WezTerm's development pace improve with expanded contributors in 2025? Monitor [GitHub releases](https://github.com/wezterm/wezterm/releases) for cadence.
- When does Ghostty ship native Windows support? That may be worth evaluating as an alternative when available.
- WezTerm SSH multiplexing: is it actually useful for accessing remote dev machines, or is tmux still better for that use case?
- Performance difference between WezTerm and Windows Terminal on WSL2 specifically — subjective reports are mixed.

## Extracted Principles

No new principles file warranted — this is a tool evaluation rather than a reusable engineering pattern. Key takeaway noted: for GPU-accelerated WSL2 terminals in 2026, WezTerm is the top cross-platform choice; Ghostty is the performance leader but lacks Windows support.
