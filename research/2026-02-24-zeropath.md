# ZeroPath: AI-Native SAST & AppSec Platform

## Context

In the prior research session on appsec security tooling (2026-02-24), ZeroPath was explicitly named as an open question:

> "Tools like Corgea and ZeroPath use LLMs as part of the detection engine itself (not just post-processing). Early results suggest they can catch logic-level vulnerabilities that pattern-matching SAST misses. But are they mature enough, and can they be self-hosted/open-source?"

ZeroPath appeared as a Google Ads sponsored result, positioning itself as an AI-native alternative to traditional SAST tools. This research investigates whether ZeroPath is materially better than the free/open-source stack already documented (Semgrep, CodeQL, Bearer), particularly for AI-generated code contexts. It was identified as one of the top AI SAST products by independent security researcher Joshua Rogers, who used it to find ~170 real bugs in the curl codebase.

## Findings

### 1. What ZeroPath Is

ZeroPath is an AI-native application security platform founded ≈2024, launched v1 in 2025. Core claim: use LLMs combined with Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) analysis to find vulnerabilities the way a pentester would—through contextual reasoning about code intent—rather than through rule-based pattern matching.

Headline metrics from their own benchmarks and customer data:
- 750+ organizations secured
- 125,000+ code scans per month
- 18 programming languages supported
- Critical CVEs disclosed affecting Netflix, Hulu, Salesforce code
- ~170 verified bugs found in the curl open-source project

### 2. Technical Architecture

**Step 1: AST Generation**
ZeroPath uses [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) to convert source code into Abstract Syntax Trees — hierarchical structural representations of code that capture syntax relationships.

**Step 2: Call Graph Construction**
From ASTs, ZeroPath builds call graphs: maps of function invocations that provide a "complete summary of the application's structure and behavior." This enables analysis across file and module boundaries — a class of vulnerability traditional SAST often misses because it can't follow multi-hop data flows.

**Step 3: Graph Enrichment**
The call graphs are enriched with semantic information: HTTP endpoints, HTTP methods, authentication mechanisms, session handling, authorization checks, and other security controls. This transforms raw code structure into an actionable behavioral model of the application.

**Step 4: AI-Powered Detection**
Rather than pattern matching against known vulnerability signatures, ZeroPath employs:
- **AI-based sink/source identification** — LLM determines which functions receive user input (sources) and which perform dangerous operations (sinks), without requiring a manually-maintained rule list
- **Tree-of-Thoughts reasoning** — multi-path exploration of vulnerability scenarios to evaluate exploitability under different conditions
- **ReAct framework** — structured tool usage during investigation (reason → act → observe → repeat)
- **Multi-agent validation** — exploitability scored via CVSS 4.0 heuristics across multiple LLM agents

**Key design differentiation from Semgrep/CodeQL:**
Traditional SAST vendors (as ZeroPath puts it, including Semgrep, OpenGrep, and others) rely on rule engines. Rules must be written and maintained for each vulnerability class. ZeroPath's LLM-first approach can detect novel vulnerability patterns and business logic flaws without predefined rules. The tradeoff: LLM-based detection is less deterministic and more expensive to run.

### 3. What It Detects (That Traditional SAST Misses)

**Business Logic Vulnerabilities** — the class that makes ZeroPath most interesting:
- Price manipulation / workflow bypass
- Broken authentication (auth logic, session management)
- IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) — 8 separate IDOR vulnerabilities found in RAGFlow
- Missing authorization checks ("anyone can access this resource")
- Tenant isolation failures

**Traditional Vulnerability Classes** (also covered):
- SQL injection via data-flow tracking
- XSS and output encoding issues
- Directory traversal / local file inclusion
- Unsafe deserialization (Python pickle — CVE-2024-48946 in Hulu's Monaco)
- Command injection
- Prototype pollution

**AI/LLM-Specific Vulnerabilities** (specifically for AI-generated code or AI-integrated applications):
- Prompt injection attacks (user input that manipulates AI behavior)
- Insecure output handling (unvalidated LLM responses leading to XSS/injection)
- Training data poisoning vectors
- Model denial-of-service (resource exhaustion in LLM pipelines)
- Sensitive information disclosure through AI outputs

**Protocol-Level and Developer Intent Issues** (demonstrated in curl case study):
- RFC compliance violations in protocol implementations (Telnet, TFTP, SMTP, IMAP)
- Dead or broken code (e.g., non-functional Kerberos FTP implementation)
- API contract mismatches where code behavior contradicts documentation/comments
- Memory management errors and resource leaks in C/C++

### 4. Benchmark Performance

ZeroPath published self-reported benchmarks (July 2025) based on a dataset derived from Xbow's benchmark suite:

**Technical Vulnerabilities (31 benchmarks):**
| Tool | Detection Rate | False Positive Rate |
|------|---------------|---------------------|
| ZeroPath | **80.0%** | 25.0% |
| Semgrep | 57.1% | 45.0% |
| Snyk | 40.0% | 30.0% |
| Bearer | 5.7% | 0.0% |

**Business Logic & Authentication Vulnerabilities (8 benchmarks):**
| Tool | Detection Rate | False Positive Rate |
|------|---------------|---------------------|
| ZeroPath | **87.5%** | 0.0% |
| Semgrep | 12.5% | 0.0% |
| Snyk | 0.0% | 0.0% |
| Bearer | 0.0% | 0.0% |

**Caveats:** These benchmarks are self-reported by ZeroPath. Independent benchmark from sanj.dev (2025) uses a different methodology and does not include ZeroPath, so direct comparison isn't possible. The business logic benchmark of 8 samples is a small dataset. However, the direction is consistent with independent researcher findings.

**From the sanj.dev benchmark (Semgrep vs CodeQL vs Snyk):**
- Snyk Code: 92/100 detection, 85% accuracy, 8% FPR, 45s scan
- Semgrep: 87/100 detection, 82% accuracy, 12% FPR, 90s scan
- CodeQL: 84/100 detection, 88% accuracy, 5% FPR, 8min scan

ZeroPath's 80% detection on technical vulns with 25% FPR is roughly in line with these tools — the real differentiation is the 87.5% on business logic where rule-based tools score near zero.

### 5. Real-World Validation

**curl Case Study (best external validation):**
Security researcher Joshua Rogers ran ZeroPath against the curl codebase — a project that already runs Coverity, CodeQL, scan-build, and clang-tidy continuously. ZeroPath produced ~200 potential problem reports; Rogers filed ~20 PRs, and curl maintainers used the raw output to produce ~150 more patches, totaling approximately 170 verified issues fixed.

Daniel Stenberg (curl's lead maintainer) was "almost blown away by the quality of some of the findings" and acknowledged some were "truly awesome" — findings that multiple industry-standard tools had missed for years.

Types found in curl: logic flaws in file handling (rustls), auth mechanism errors (SASL), connection management issues (HTTP/3, SSH/SFTP), RFC violations, memory management errors, broken Kerberos FTP.

False positive rate in this real-world test: approximately 20% — which Rogers considers acceptable for the signal-to-noise ratio.

**Zero-Day Discoveries (enterprise codebases):**
- Netflix E2nest: Local File Inclusion (CVE-2024-9301)
- Hulu Monaco: Remote Code Execution via pickle deserialization (CVE-2024-48946)
- Salesforce LogAI: Directory Traversal
- RAGFlow: 8 IDOR vulnerabilities (tenant isolation failures, unauthorized access to conversations, files, API keys)
- Fonoster Voice Server, LibrePhotos, DB-GPT, Uptrain, Clone-Voice: various RCE/directory traversal findings

### 8. Competitive Positioning

**How it positions against the free stack:**

| Criterion | ZeroPath (Team) | Semgrep (OSS engine) | CodeQL (public repos) |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Business logic vulns | **~88%** | ~12% | ~20% est. |
| Technical vuln detection | ~80% | ~57% | ~84% |
| False positive rate | ~25% | ~45% | ~5% |
| Cost | $60/contributor/mo | Free (OSS engine) | Free (public repos) |
| Real-time (MCP/IDE) | Yes | Yes (MCP server) | No (CI only) |
| Autofix | Yes (LLM patches) | No | Limited |
| Business logic coverage | **Yes** | Minimal | Limited |

**The core trade-off:** ZeroPath costs $60/contributor/month for capabilities that the free OSS stack fundamentally cannot replicate (business logic detection, developer intent inference). If business logic vulnerabilities are your concern — or if you're working with complex auth/authorization systems, multi-tenant SaaS, or AI-integrated applications — ZeroPath's LLM-native approach appears materially better than pattern matching tools.

If you need free/open-source security tooling with CI integration, the Semgrep + CodeQL + Bearer + Gitleaks stack remains the right answer.

**Third-party competitive rankings:**
- [Arnica blog (2026)](https://www.arnica.io/blog/top-6-ai-sast-tools-for-2026-the-quick-guide-to-agentic-static-application-security-testing): ZeroPath ranked #3 in AI SAST tools for 2026 (behind Arnica and Corgea)
- [Joshua Rogers independent research](https://joshua.hu/retrospective-zeropath-ai-sast-source-code-security-scanners-vulnerability): ZeroPath ranked #1 of AI SAST tools tested, ahead of Ghost Security and DryRun Security
- [Joshua Rogers overview of AI SASTs](https://joshua.hu/llm-engineer-review-sast-security-ai-tools-pentesters): Identifies ZeroPath, Corgea, and Almanax as top three products

**Weaknesses noted (Arnica blog):**
- Full repository scans on large codebases run slowly (LLM processing time)
- Limited contextual understanding of organizational security priorities
- LLM-generated patches don't always align well with developer workflows
- Traditional CI/CD pipeline reliance limits visibility between deployments

### 9. ZeroPath as a 4th Layer in Agentic Security

The prior research established a three-layer model for securing AI-agent-generated code:
1. Pre-generation context (CLAUDE.md instructions, OpenSSF guidelines)
2. In-flow scanning (Semgrep MCP server, pre-commit hooks)
3. CI/CD gates (Semgrep/CodeQL, Bearer, Gitleaks, Trivy, ZAP)

ZeroPath fits as a natural **4th layer** — or as an upgrade to Layer 3 — particularly for:
- Finding the business logic vulnerabilities that Layers 1-3 miss
- Providing LLM-generated, context-aware autofixes (not just finding issues)
- Enhancing existing tools (running on top of Semgrep/Snyk output to eliminate FPs)
- Catching AI-specific vulnerabilities (prompt injection, insecure LLM output handling)

The cost question is real: at $60/contributor/month, a 5-person team is $3,600/year. For solo developers or small teams, the free OSS stack is likely sufficient unless business logic security is a priority concern. For larger teams building multi-tenant SaaS, financial applications, or AI-integrated products, ZeroPath's coverage of auth/authorization/IDOR vulnerabilities may justify the cost.

## Open Questions

1. **BYOK LLM configuration:** Which LLM providers does ZeroPath support for BYOK? Can you use Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, or only specific models? The data handling implications depend on which model processes your code.

2. **On-premises scan speed:** Given that large repo scans are slow on cloud infrastructure, how does self-hosted performance compare? LLM inference on-prem requires significant compute (GPU).

3. **Benchmark independence:** ZeroPath's benchmarks are self-reported against an 8-sample business logic dataset. Is there an independent benchmark (NIST SARD, OWASP WebGoat, Juliet Test Suite) that includes ZeroPath vs. CodeQL/Semgrep?

4. **Corgea comparison:** Both ZeroPath and Corgea are LLM-native SAST tools. What's the meaningful differentiation? Corgea positions as a remediation layer (fix-first) while ZeroPath positions as detection + fix.

5. **Rate of model improvement:** ZeroPath's detection quality depends entirely on the LLMs it uses. As models improve (Claude 4, GPT-5), how does ZeroPath keep its detection quality current? Is there model versioning or regression testing?

6. **False positive management at scale:** 25% FPR means 1 in 4 findings needs manual triage. At 125K scans/month, how do teams manage triage workload without friction? Does ZeroPath learn from dismissals?

7. **Hook-based enforcement vs. PR scanning:** ZeroPath scans PRs (< 60 seconds). Semgrep's Cursor hooks run immediately on file edit. For agentic workflows where code is generated rapidly between commits, does PR-boundary scanning create a timing gap that allows vulnerable code to compound before review?

## Extracted Principles

Research produced one actionable update to `principles/security.md`:

- **LLM-Native SAST as a 4th Security Layer** — ZeroPath and similar tools (Corgea, Almanax) address a class of business logic and authorization vulnerabilities that deterministic rule-based SAST (Semgrep, CodeQL) fundamentally cannot detect through pattern matching alone. At $60/contributor/month, this is a paid layer worth evaluating for teams building multi-tenant SaaS, financial applications, or AI-integrated products where auth/authorization errors are high-severity. For solo developers or small teams, the free OSS stack covers the common vulnerability classes adequately.
