# Five Whys

## Context

Researched as a foundational root cause analysis technique relevant to incident postmortems, agile retrospectives, and continuous improvement workflows. The existing team-process-practices.md covers blameless postmortems at a high level but does not address the specific mechanics of root cause investigation methods. Five Whys is among the most widely used techniques in this space and warrants dedicated documentation.

## Findings

### 1. Origin and History

The Five Whys technique was developed by **Sakichi Toyoda** (1867–1930), founder of Toyota Industries, in the 1930s. It was formalized and popularized by **Taiichi Ohno**, the architect of the Toyota Production System (TPS), who became an avid practitioner from the 1950s onward. Ohno described it as "the basis of Toyota's scientific approach" and made it a core component of TPS induction training.

The technique spread beyond manufacturing through the Lean and Six Sigma movements and is now widely used in software engineering, healthcare, aviation, and general operations management.

### 2. The Core Technique

**What it is**: An iterative interrogative method that asks "Why?" repeatedly — typically five times — to trace cause-and-effect chains from observable symptoms back to underlying systemic causes.

**The canonical example** (Taiichi Ohno's machine stoppage):

| Level | Question | Answer |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Why did the machine stop? | Fuse blew from overload |
| 2 | Why was there an overload? | Bearing lacked lubrication |
| 3 | Why was there insufficient lubrication? | Oil pump wasn't pumping adequately |
| 4 | Why was the pump failing? | Shaft was worn and rattling |
| 5 | Why was the shaft worn? | **No strainer attached — metal debris entered** |

**Corrective action**: Install a strainer to prevent debris. This addresses the system gap, not just the symptom.

### 3. The Process (7 Steps)

Following MindTools' formulation:

1. **Assemble a cross-functional team** — People with direct hands-on experience of the process/failure. Include a neutral facilitator. Those closest to the work provide the most accurate insights.
2. **Define the problem precisely** — Write a clear problem statement including: what happened, when, where, and measurable impact. Agree on this statement before proceeding.
3. **Ask the first "Why?"** — Seek factual, evidence-based answers. No speculation. Record as concise phrases.
4. **Ask "Why?" four more times** — Each iteration targets the previous answer, not the original problem. Follow the causal chain.
5. **Know when to stop** — The "5" is approximate. Stop when:
   - Asking "Why?" yields no further useful information.
   - A logical, actionable countermeasure becomes evident.
   - You've reached a systemic gap that, if fixed, prevents recurrence.
6. **Define countermeasures** (not just solutions) — A countermeasure prevents future recurrence at the systemic level. A "solution" may only address the immediate symptom.
7. **Monitor effectiveness** — Assign owners, set deadlines, verify the corrective action prevented recurrence (allow 3–6 months for verification).

### 4. Key Principles for Effective Use

**"Human error" is never a root cause.** The most common and most harmful mistake in Five Whys analysis is accepting "an operator forgot to check X" as a final answer. This describes what happened, not why the system allowed it. The next question must be: "Why didn't the process catch this before it reached the operator?" and "Why was there no verification step?" Robust processes assume humans will make mistakes and build in safeguards.

**Focus on systems, not people.** Blame-focused cultures undermine honest investigation. If people fear individual punishment from postmortems, they hide information, and the analysis becomes theater. The goal is systemic learning, not individual accountability.

**Evidence at every level.** Each "Why?" answer must be grounded in verifiable facts: physical observations, data logs, measurements, or witness testimony. Answers that cannot be verified lead to ineffective countermeasures.

**One causal chain at a time.** When multiple branches exist, investigate one completely before exploring alternatives. Splitting attention across branches simultaneously leads to shallow analysis on all paths.

**The countermeasure test.** You've found the root cause when you can state: "If we implement X change, this specific failure mode cannot recur." If you can't name that change, you haven't gone deep enough.

### 5. Software Engineering Application

#### In Incident Postmortems

Five Whys is widely used in software incident postmortems (SRE, DevOps contexts). An example walkthrough:

**Problem**: 20% of users received 500 errors during checkout

| Level | Why | Answer |
|-------|-----|--------|
| 1 | Why did users get 500 errors? | Code threw a NullPointerException on `paymentMethod.id` |
| 2 | Why was `paymentMethod.id` null? | 20% of users don't have a saved payment method |
| 3 | Why was there no null check? | Developer didn't add one — no standard for null safety |
| 4 | Why didn't tests catch this? | Test fixtures only included users with payment methods |
| 5 | Why did it go to production? | No canary deployment or staged rollout process |

**Systemic fixes**: Null safety linting rules, test data that mirrors production distribution, canary deployments.

Google SRE does not prescribe a specific RCA technique — teams choose the method best suited to their services. However, postmortem templates often include a Five Whys chain as a structured section. The key SRE requirement: all contributing root causes must be well understood, not just the most obvious one.

#### In Agile Retrospectives

Five Whys is a standard retrospective technique for diagnosing process failures (e.g., why a sprint goal was missed, why a bug escaped to production, why deployments are slow). Key adaptations for retro context:

- Apply to specific, real problems — not hypothetical scenarios
- Start with problems the team already agrees are real
- Use causes that actually happened, not causes that could happen
- Don't run Five Whys on more than 1–2 problems per session (cognitive overload)
- Action items must be assigned with owners and timeframes

### 6. Limitations and Criticisms

#### The Subjectivity Problem (WYLFIWYF)
The most fundamental critique: investigators unconsciously select causes that match their preexisting hypotheses. Researchers call this **WYLFIWYF** ("What You Look For Is What You Find"). The same incident analyzed by different people produces different Five Whys trees — not because both are valid paths to the truth, but because each reflects the investigator's mental model of the system.

#### The Linearity Problem (Complex Systems)
Five Whys assumes a single linear causal chain. Modern complex systems fail in complex ways — through multiple jointly cooperating causes, where each factor is "necessary but insufficient in itself," per Dr. Richard Cook's research. The AWS S3 outage example: an engineer's command error + validation script bugs + missing safeguards all converged. Five Whys would arbitrarily pick one thread and miss the others.

#### The Knowledge Ceiling
Investigators cannot discover causes they don't already know about. The chain stops wherever the facilitator's knowledge runs out. This is addressable with cross-functional teams but is a structural limitation.

#### Lack of Repeatability
Different people derive different Five Whys trees for the same incident. This can be reframed constructively (multiple trees = more complete cause map) but means Five Whys alone cannot serve as an auditable, reproducible investigation method for high-stakes failures.

#### Doesn't Prioritize
Five Whys tells you *what* caused a problem but not *which* problems are worth investigating or *which* root causes to address first when resources are limited.

### 7. The "How Not Why" Alternative (Salesforce Engineering)

Robert Blumen's influential critique argues that for complex system failures, teams should ask **"How did the system fail?"** rather than "Why?". The key insight: the word "why" implies a single cause and invites blame assignment. The word "how" opens investigation to the full network of contributing factors.

**The recommended approach**:
1. Identify all contributing factors that *jointly* caused the failure
2. Create a diagram showing relationships between factors
3. Determine leverage points for system improvements
4. Prioritize improvements based on stability impact and available resources

This aligns with the Google SRE philosophy of blameless postmortems focused on systemic conditions, not individual actions.

### 8. Combinations and Variants

#### Fishbone (Ishikawa) + Five Whys
The most common enhancement for complex problems:
1. Use a **Fishbone diagram** to map all possible categories of causes (People, Process, Equipment, Materials, Environment, Management — the "6 Ms" in manufacturing; adapted for software)
2. Identify the highest-probability branches
3. Apply **Five Whys** to each candidate branch independently
4. Compare results to find the most actionable leverage points

This hybrid preserves Five Whys' depth while avoiding its single-chain blindspot.

#### Five Whys + Five Hows
After completing the Five Whys chain, trace back up with "How can we prevent this?" at each level. This produces a hierarchy of countermeasures from tactical (bottom) to systemic (top), allowing teams to implement the most feasible fix at the right level.

#### Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
For proactive (pre-incident) analysis of complex systems. More rigorous than Five Whys — identifies failure modes, effects, and causes systematically, then assigns Risk Priority Numbers (RPN) to prioritize mitigation. Use FMEA where Five Whys is too reactive or too simple for the stakes.

### 9. When to Use vs. When to Use Something Else

**Use Five Whys for**:
- Simple to moderately complex problems with a dominant causal path
- Recurring defects or quality issues
- Process bottlenecks
- Sprint retrospective process failures
- Incident postmortems as a starting point (not the only method)
- Fast analyses where speed matters more than completeness (30–60 minutes)

**Use Fishbone + Five Whys for**:
- Problems with multiple plausible cause categories
- First time investigating a type of failure
- Complex incidents where linear chains won't capture the full picture

**Use FMEA for**:
- Proactive risk analysis before deployment/launch
- High-stakes systems where failures have severe consequences
- When you need a repeatable, auditable methodology

**Use the "How" approach (or a cause map) for**:
- Major outages in complex distributed systems
- Incidents where human error appears to be "the cause"
- Situations where the organization needs a non-blaming framing

**Do NOT use Five Whys**:
- As the sole investigation method for major incidents
- When participants lack sufficient domain knowledge
- For deeply organizational or cultural problems (Five Whys will stop at "culture is bad")
- When there are clearly multiple simultaneous contributing causes

---

### 10. AI-Assisted Five Whys (Emerging)

LLM-assisted root cause analysis is an active research area:

- **EuroSys 2024**: Automated RCA for cloud incidents via LLMs
- **FSE Industry 2024**: LLM-based agents for RCA that can dynamically collect logs, metrics, and database queries (addresses the static investigation limitation)
- **AIOps 2025 (ICSE)**: GenAI + Five Whys for legacy banking system failures
- **Algomox / BigPanda**: Commercial platforms using LLMs for initial incident triage, correlating with historical incidents, and suggesting causal hypotheses

The emerging pattern: LLMs are effective at generating candidate "Why?" chains (hypothesis generation) and cross-referencing historical incidents. Human judgment is still needed for verifying answers and assigning countermeasures. The combination — AI-generated chain, human-verified at each step — reduces the knowledge-ceiling limitation.

### 11. Implementation Framework

For teams adopting Five Whys as a standard practice:

1. **Start with a pilot**: One team, one category of problems (e.g., only for P1 incidents)
2. **Train facilitation**: The facilitator role is critical — neutral, evidence-enforcing, blame-deflecting
3. **Use a template**: Structured doc with problem statement, 5 rows for why/answer, countermeasures table with owner + deadline
4. **Debrief the process**: After each analysis, ask "Did this produce an actionable countermeasure?" If not, analyze why
5. **Track recurrence**: Measure whether the same problem recurs after corrective action (3–6 month horizon)
6. **Success signal**: Frontline engineers bring forward more problems proactively — this indicates psychological safety has been established

Success metrics:
- **Problem recurrence rate** — same issues should stop reappearing
- **Corrective action quality** — systemic fixes vs. "be more careful" requests
- **Staff engagement** — are people bringing problems forward?

## Open Questions

1. **How does Five Whys interact with distributed tracing tools?** In microservices environments, the causal chain is partially captured in traces/spans. Does automated trace analysis effectively augment or replace some "Why?" steps?

2. **Optimal cadence for retrospective use**: Is Five Whys better as a reactive tool (triggered by specific incidents) or as a standing retrospective format? The literature suggests reactive, but some teams use it standing.

3. **LLM-assisted Five Whys in practice**: What is the actual workflow for using Claude/GPT-4 to generate candidate causal chains, and how do teams validate AI-generated hypotheses without re-introducing confirmation bias?

4. **Five Whys vs. OODA loop for incident response**: OODA (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act) is used in real-time incident response; Five Whys is post-incident. Is there value in applying Five Whys thinking during active incidents, or is this scope-creep?

## Extracted Principles

Principles added to [principles/team-process-practices.md](../principles/team-process-practices.md):

- **Five Whys: "Human Error" Is Never a Root Cause** — accepting individual mistakes as terminal stops systemic investigation.
- **Stop at Countermeasures, Not Symptoms** — the countermeasure test: can you name a systemic change that prevents recurrence?
- **Use Fishbone + Five Whys for Complex Failures** — the hybrid prevents the single-chain blindspot.
- **Complex Incidents Need "How" Not Just "Why"** — multiple cooperating causes require cause maps, not linear chains.
