# GameLift — Interview-Context Deep Dive

## Context

This was brought up in an interview at a game development company called Refactor Games. Prior research from 2026-02-18 covers GameLift's full architecture, pricing, integration, and alternatives comprehensively. This file focuses on aspects most relevant to Refactor Games' specific products and technical context:

- **Football Simulator** (Unity, physics-based sports, Steam Early Access, planned online multiplayer)
- **Netflix FIFA Game** (UE5, built with Delphi Interactive, cloud-streamed to TVs for World Cup 2026)
- **Journeyman** (1-10 player co-op ARPG, planned PvP)

Key questions from the interview context: Why would Refactor Games use GameLift? What are the specific integration paths for their Unity and UE5 games? How does physics-based multiplayer interact with GameLift's model? How does GameLift Streams factor into the Netflix game distribution strategy?

## Findings

### 1. Why GameLift Fits Refactor Games

Refactor Games' product lineup maps to GameLift's strengths almost perfectly:

**Football Simulator (Unity)**: Session-based sports game with clear match boundaries. Planned online multiplayer (cross-platform) fits GameLift's core model — matches start, players compete, match ends. FlexMatch handles skill-based matchmaking. FleetIQ + Spot Instances keep hosting costs manageable for a startup. Physics-based gameplay requires server-authoritative architecture (dedicated servers, not P2P), which is exactly what GameLift provides.

**Netflix FIFA (UE5)**: Netflix is already a GameLift customer. Their first multiplayer game, Squid Game: Unleashed, launched on GameLift Servers + FlexMatch and became the #1 free action game in 57 countries within 2 weeks ([Netflix GameLift case study](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/netflix-amazon-gamelift-servers-case-study/)). Richard Musser, Netflix Platform Director: "By using a solution tuned for games, we can focus on what's unique to our game." For the FIFA game, GameLift Streams is the likely distribution path — streaming UE5-rendered gameplay to TVs via WebRTC at 1080p/60fps. The game server layer would use GameLift Servers for multiplayer session management.

**Journeyman (1-10 co-op)**: Smaller player counts, session-based dungeon runs. Good fit for Realtime Servers (relay) if combat is client-authoritative, or custom servers if server-authoritative (souls-like combat suggests the latter). PvP mode would benefit from FlexMatch.

### 2. The Netflix Cloud Gaming Connection

This is the most strategically important angle. Netflix's cloud gaming strategy as of Q4 2025 earnings is **cloud-first, TV-focused** ([Netflix boss: cloud TV games are 'big priority' in 2026](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-boss-says-cloud-based-tv-games-are-a-big-priority-in-2026)). The model:

- TV is the display
- Phone is the controller
- Netflix's servers do the rendering
- No downloads, no installs, no special hardware

Netflix's infrastructure advantage: 700M+ global users on home entertainment screens plus substantial edge compute (Open Connect CDN). Netflix CTO Elizabeth Stone noted the company is building a "whole new generation of Open Connect servers" specifically for game streaming — different hardware than video streaming appliances, potentially located in Netflix's ISP-embedded Points of Presence to minimize latency ([Fast Company deep dive](https://www.fastcompany.com/91299135/netflix-built-an-army-of-servers-to-stream-tv-now-its-powering-games)).

**GameLift Streams** launched March 2025 and fits this model exactly:
- Fully managed GPU instances (NVIDIA A10G or T4, Gen6 L4 GPUs added Dec 2025)
- WebRTC streaming at 1080p/60fps to any browser
- Available in 6 AWS regions (US East Virginia/Ohio, US West Oregon, Tokyo, Frankfurt, Ireland)
- Gen6 stream classes provide up to 2x performance over Gen4
- Pricing: per allocated capacity-hour (whether streaming or not)

For the Netflix FIFA game specifically, the architecture likely looks like:

```
Player's TV (Netflix app)          Player's Phone (controller)
         |                                    |
         v                                    v
   Netflix Platform  <--- controller input ---|
         |
         v
   GameLift Streams (GPU rendering, UE5 game, WebRTC encoding)
         |
         v
   GameLift Servers (multiplayer session management, FlexMatch)
```

Netflix's earlier party games (Boggle, Pictionary, LEGO Party) reached ~10% of eligible members — "tens of millions of potential players" — without a marquee title. FIFA timed for World Cup 2026 could be significantly larger. The initial game catalogue is expanding in 2026 per co-CEO Greg Peters ([CGMagazine](https://www.cgmagonline.com/articles/cloud-gaming-priority-for-netflix-in-2026/)).

### 3. Physics-Based Multiplayer: The Hard Problem

Refactor Games' core innovation is their Sports Physics Engine — real-time ragdolls where every animation is computed per-frame from physics simulation. Networking this is one of the hardest problems in game development.

**Why physics networking is hard:**
- Physics simulations are chaotic — tiny floating-point differences compound into wildly different outcomes
- High tick rates are needed for responsive feel (30-60Hz minimum for sports; competitive shooters use 64-128Hz)
- Each tick must simulate physics for all active bodies, which is CPU-intensive
- Client-side prediction + server reconciliation is the standard approach, but "don't use rollback netcode for physics heavy games because they are CPU bound" ([Glenn Fiedler / Gaffer On Games](https://gafferongames.com/post/networked_physics_in_virtual_reality/))

**Server-authoritative physics approaches by engine:**

*Unreal Engine 5 (Netflix FIFA)*: UE5 has a built-in Networked Physics system with three replication modes ([UE5 Networked Physics docs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/networked-physics-overview)):
1. **Default Mode (Legacy)**: Server replicates velocity; client corrections are visible and jarring
2. **Predictive Interpolation**: Server-authoritative but clients can apply predicted forces. Handles corrections based on RTT and send-rate. Better for interactable objects.
3. **Resimulation Mode**: Most advanced. Client runs fully forward-predicted half an RTT ahead of server. Caches physics state history, compares to server state, triggers resimulation on divergence — rewinds, corrects, simulates forward. CPU/memory intensive but most accurate. Uses `UNetworkPhysicsComponent` (C++ only, manual implementation required).

For a physics-based sports game, Resimulation Mode is likely necessary — but it's expensive and complex. The trade-off: fidelity of the physics simulation vs. network bandwidth and CPU cost per server instance.

*Unity (Football Simulator)*: Unity's Netcode for Entities supports physics prediction for "predicted ghosts" — objects simulated by both client and server with client prediction and server correction. Unity's approach is less mature than UE5's resimulation system. Alternative: Photon's Quantum (deterministic ECS with rollback, specifically designed for physics games) or FishNet/Mirror with custom physics sync.

**GameLift implications for physics games:**
- **Instance sizing**: Physics simulation is CPU-bound. Compute-optimized instances (C-series) are recommended — C5.large (2 vCPU) for lighter games, C5.xlarge or C6g.xlarge (4 vCPU) for physics-heavy. Graviton ARM instances (C6g/C7g) offer better price-performance for compute workloads.
- **Processes per instance**: With physics-heavy servers, you likely run 1-2 server processes per instance rather than the 5-10 possible for lightweight games. This affects scaling economics.
- **Tick rate vs. cost**: A 60Hz physics server consumes significantly more CPU than a 20Hz turn-based server. Match this against instance costs — a football match with 22 physics-driven players at 60Hz is a heavy workload.
- **Spot Instance viability**: Sports matches (10-30 minutes) are ideal for Spot Instances — short enough that interruption risk is manageable, and FleetIQ optimizes placement.

### 4. Engine-Specific Integration Paths

**Unity Integration (Football Simulator)**:

The GameLift Plugin for Unity provides guided UI workflows for deployment. Integration involves:

1. **Server SDK**: C# Server SDK 5.x (supports .NET 6.0 and .NET 8.0 as of April 2025). Open-sourced on GitHub May 2025.
2. **Unity versions**: 2021.3 LTS, 2022.3 LTS supported
3. **Deployment path**: Build Linux headless server → upload as GameLift build → create fleet
4. **Local development**: Register dev workstation as Anywhere fleet for iterative testing without cloud deploys. "You remove the overhead of a managed fleet during testing — no longer have to upload each new build iteration, create a new fleet, and wait 15+ minutes" ([AWS local testing blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/gametech/local-testing-to-cloud-deployment-development-workflows-in-amazon-gamelift/))

Key workflow:
```
Local: Unity editor → build Linux server → register Anywhere fleet → test locally
Cloud: Upload build → create managed EC2 fleet → configure auto-scaling → FlexMatch
```

**Unreal Engine 5 Integration (Netflix FIFA)**:

The GameLift Plugin for UE5 is more mature, with streamlined setup as of May 2025:
- Supports UE 5.6 (August 2025)
- Plugin deploys via CloudFormation: IAM roles, S3 bucket, Cognito auth, Lambda functions
- Fewer prerequisites than before (CMake, OpenSSL, cross-compile toolchain are automated)
- UE5's built-in dedicated server target type maps directly to GameLift's model

### 5. FlexMatch for Sports Game Matchmaking

FlexMatch is the matchmaking engine that matters most for Refactor's sports games. For a football/soccer game, the matchmaking requirements are:

**Team structure**: Two evenly-sized teams (e.g., 1v1, 5v5, 11v11). FlexMatch supports 2-200 players per match. Example rule set structure for a sports game:

```json
{
  "name": "football-match",
  "ruleLanguageVersion": "1.0",
  "teams": [{
    "name": "home",
    "minPlayers": 1,
    "maxPlayers": 11
  }, {
    "name": "away",
    "minPlayers": 1,
    "maxPlayers": 11
  }],
  "rules": [{
    "name": "EvenTeams",
    "type": "comparison",
    "measurements": ["count(teams[home].players)"],
    "referenceValue": "count(teams[away].players)",
    "operation": "="
  }, {
    "name": "SkillMatch",
    "type": "distance",
    "measurements": ["avg(teams[*].players.attributes[skill])"],
    "referenceValue": "avg(flatten(teams[*].players.attributes[skill]))",
    "maxDistance": 10
  }],
  "expansions": [{
    "target": "rules[SkillMatch].maxDistance",
    "steps": [{
      "waitTimeSeconds": 5,
      "value": 25
    }, {
      "waitTimeSeconds": 15,
      "value": 50
    }]
  }]
}
```

Key FlexMatch features for sports:
- **Expandable rules**: Gradually relax skill requirements so players don't wait forever. Start with ±10 skill, expand to ±50 after 15 seconds.
- **Match backfilling**: Keep in-progress games full when players disconnect mid-match
- **Latency-based matching**: Group players by region for low-ping games
- **Multiple matchmakers**: Different rule sets for ranked vs. casual, different team sizes
- **AI-powered skill rating**: AWS provides a reference architecture using SageMaker to train ML models that infer holistic skill values from in-game factors (not just win/loss). These values feed into FlexMatch as player attributes. ([AWS SageMaker + FlexMatch blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/gametech/training-ai-models-for-skill-based-matchmaking-using-amazon-sagemaker-ai/))

**FlexMatch Testing Toolkit**: A simulation tool that lets you test matchmaking rules before deployment — create virtual player profiles, run simulated matchmaking, validate rule sets without running game servers. Essential for iterating on matchmaking quality. ([GameLift Testing Toolkit](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-gamelift-testing-toolkit))

### 6. Persistent/Long-Running Worlds (Journeyman Consideration)

Journeyman is described as co-op ARPG with procedural dungeon content. If sessions are dungeon runs (start → clear → end), it's a classic GameLift session model. But if there's a persistent shared world (lobby, town, hub area), GameLift can support this via a persistent world pattern:

**Architecture** ([AWS Persistent World Guidance](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/guidance-for-persistent-world-game-hosting-on-aws)):
- **World Manager Lambda**: Triggered every 60 seconds via EventBridge, checks DynamoDB for world configs, provisions GameLift sessions
- **DynamoDB Global Tables**: Store world state, player data. Global Tables provide multi-region eventual consistency.
- **Dynamic Worlds**: Auto-spawn instances when existing ones fill. Auto-terminate after 5 minutes without players.
- **Server rotation**: Processes terminate after 24 hours; World Manager auto-replaces. Player state persisted to DynamoDB survives rotation.

Cost estimate from the reference architecture: ~$1.80/month per concurrent user at 1,500 CCU on C5.xlarge instances.

Limitation: If Journeyman needs true MMO-scale (thousands of players in one world, world partitioning), GameLift is a poor fit. Use EC2/ECS/EKS directly. But for 1-10 player co-op instances, GameLift is ideal.

### 7. Development Workflow: Local → Cloud Progression

For a small studio like Refactor (~8-17 people), the dev workflow matters as much as the production architecture:

**Stage 1 — Local Testing (Anywhere Fleets)**:
Register each developer's workstation as an Anywhere fleet. Run game server locally, test full GameLift integration (session creation, player validation, FlexMatch) without cloud costs. Update game server binary and test immediately — no upload/deploy/wait cycle.

**Stage 2 — Cloud Test Environment**:
Create a small managed EC2 fleet (1-2 instances) for integration testing. Test auto-scaling, Spot Instances, multi-region placement. Use the GameLift Testing Toolkit to validate FlexMatch rules with simulated players.

**Stage 3 — Production**:
Container fleets recommended for production — decouple fleet from build, rolling updates without fleet recreation, ~5 minute deployments. Container images stored in ECR. Auto-scaling with target-based policy (e.g., "keep 25% sessions available"). Scale-to-zero for off-peak periods.

**Key tooling**:
- **Remote console access** (August 2025): Browser-based SSH to fleet instances via SSM for debugging
- **OpenTelemetry built-in** (August 2025): Standardized metrics/traces in all Server SDKs
- **Amazon Q Developer integration** (October 2025): AI-powered console assistance for guided workflows

### 8. Cost Modeling for a Sports Game Studio

Rough cost estimate for a physics-based football game on GameLift:

**Assumptions**: 11v11 online matches, 15-minute average match duration, 60Hz tick rate, physics-heavy (1 server process per c5.xlarge @ 4 vCPU), 5,000 DAU with 500 peak concurrent matches.

**Managed EC2 with Spot**:
- 500 concurrent matches × 1 c5.xlarge each = 500 instances at peak
- c5.xlarge Spot price ~$0.068/hr (US East, ~70% discount from $0.237 On-Demand)
- 500 instances × $0.068/hr × 6 peak hours/day × 30 days = ~$6,120/month
- Off-peak (auto-scaling to ~50 instances): ~$612/month
- **Rough total: ~$7,000-8,000/month** at 5K DAU with Spot

**With Scale-to-Zero** (non-peak regions): Significant savings for regional deployments where nighttime hours have zero activity.

**FlexMatch**: Free with managed hosting — no additional cost for matchmaking.

**Data Transfer**: The hidden cost. For 22-player physics game at 60Hz, bandwidth per match could be 2-5 MB/min. At scale, data transfer costs can rival or exceed compute costs. This is the biggest surprise cost for GameLift users.

### 9. Competitive Context: Why Not Alternatives?

For Refactor Games specifically:

| Solution | Fit for Refactor | Why/Why Not |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **GameLift** | Strong | Session-based sports games are the core use case. Netflix partnership already uses GameLift. FlexMatch included. FleetIQ Spot savings critical for startup economics. |
| **PlayFab** | Moderate | More features (economy, analytics) but Refactor needs hosting + matchmaking, not a full platform. Azure ecosystem, not AWS. |
| **Photon** | Moderate | Great for Unity networking layer but doesn't provide dedicated server hosting. Could use alongside GameLift for client networking. CCU pricing unpredictable at scale. |
| **Edgegap** | Moderate | Container-native, usage-based pricing, edge locations. But no FlexMatch equivalent, less mature, smaller ecosystem. |
| **Agones** | Weak | Requires deep K8s expertise Refactor likely doesn't have at 8-17 people. No managed service. No built-in matchmaking. |
| **Nakama** | Weak (for hosting) | Good for social features but not dedicated server hosting. Could complement GameLift for Journeyman's social layer. |

The strongest argument for GameLift: Netflix already uses it, and Refactor is building a Netflix game. Using the same infrastructure stack reduces integration friction and leverages Netflix's existing operational knowledge.

## Open Questions

1. **Netflix's custom infrastructure**: Netflix is building custom Open Connect servers for game streaming. Will this eventually replace GameLift Streams, or will GameLift Streams be used as the managed layer on top of Netflix edge hardware (via Anywhere)?
2. **Physics determinism at scale**: How does Refactor handle the determinism problem for their ragdoll physics? Do they use a deterministic physics engine, or do they accept divergence and rely on server authority with visual interpolation?
3. **Football Simulator online multiplayer timeline**: When is online multiplayer shipping? The Steam page lists it as planned. Understanding the timeline would clarify whether GameLift integration is imminent or exploratory.
4. **Delphi Interactive's technical role**: As the partner building the Netflix FIFA game, does Delphi bring existing GameLift/AWS expertise, or is Refactor leading the infrastructure decisions?
5. **GameLift Streams latency for competitive sports**: Cloud gaming adds inherent input latency (typically 50-150ms). For a physics-based sports game where timing matters, is this acceptable? Netflix's current cloud games are party/casual — FIFA is a different latency sensitivity tier.
6. **Cost of physics servers vs. relay**: Would Refactor consider a hybrid where some game modes (casual) use cheaper relay/Realtime Servers while competitive modes use dedicated physics servers?

## Extracted Principles

No new generalizable engineering principles extracted — this is domain-specific analysis tying GameLift capabilities to a specific company's product needs. The prior research file (2026-02-18-aws-gamelift-deep-dive.md) remains the comprehensive reference.
