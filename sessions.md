<!-- Sessions will be logged below this line -->
2026-02-11 | OpenClaw low-level integration patterns | research/2026-02-11-openclaw-low-level-patterns.md | First session. Analyzed iMessage monitoring (JSON-RPC subprocess), Swabble wake-word daemon, BlueBubbles webhooks, Signal SSE, WhatsApp Baileys, pairing system, channel abstraction.
2026-02-11 | Frontend UI/UX & branding trends 2026 | research/2026-02-11-frontend-uiux-trends-2026.md | Broad survey across 4 domains: UI/UX visual design, frontend tech (CSS/frameworks), branding/identity, AI-native interfaces (A2UI, generative UI). Key finding: UI is commodity, generative UI is next paradigm.
2026-02-12 | LinkedIn channel integration spec | research/2026-02-12-linkedin-channel-spec.md | High-level spec for OpenClaw LinkedIn channel plugin. Revised to low-frequency polling (1-2x/day) instead of SSE — drops detection risk to near-zero, drastically simplifies architecture. Cron trigger + Voyager REST + state diffing. Cookie-based auth only. SSE documented as upgrade path if real-time ever needed.
2026-02-12 | Termius + tmux scrollback fix | research/2026-02-12-termius-tmux-scrollback.md | Root cause: tmux alternate screen buffer has no native scrollback; Termius (likely xterm.js-based) can't scroll alt buffer. Three-layer problem: alt screen buffer, touch→mouse event translation, xterm.js limitation. Primary fix: keyboard copy mode (Ctrl+b [). Secondary: ensure mouse on + explicit WheelUpPane bindings + update Termius.
2026-02-13 | Frontend engineering practices 2026 | research/2026-02-13-frontend-engineering-practices.md | Engineering companion to the 02-11 UI/UX research. Covers meta-frameworks (Next.js vs TanStack Start vs React Router v7), RSC patterns, Feature-Sliced Design, state management taxonomy, end-to-end type safety (tRPC+Zod), Playwright over Cypress, INP optimization, Vite+pnpm+Turborepo toolchain, CI/CD with preview deploys. Principles extracted to principles/frontend-engineering.md.
2026-02-13 | Backend & API engineering practices 2026 | research/2026-02-13-backend-api-practices.md | Comprehensive backend survey. Frameworks (Hono for edge, Fastify for Node, Express is legacy). API paradigms (tRPC internal, REST external, mix-and-match). Drizzle over Prisma for new projects. Better Auth + passkeys + server-side sessions. Zod at every boundary. OpenTelemetry from day one. BullMQ → Kafka graduation path. Multi-layer caching. Expand-and-contract migrations. Start monolith, extract services. Principles extracted to principles/backend-api-engineering.md.
2026-02-13 | DevOps & infrastructure practices 2026 | research/2026-02-13-devops-infrastructure-practices.md | Full infra survey. IaC (Terraform vs OpenTofu vs Pulumi vs SST v3). CI/CD pipeline design (GitHub Actions, caching, security). Containers (Docker for dev, Podman for prod). GitOps (ArgoCD vs Flux). Platform engineering & IDPs (Backstage 89% share). Deployment strategies (progressive delivery, feature flags). DevSecOps (SBOM, SLSA, Sigstore). Secrets management (Doppler/Infisical over .env). Observability (LGTM stack, SigNoz). Cloud platforms (Railway → Cloud Run → K8s). FinOps. Incident response (SLOs, blameless postmortems). Principles extracted to principles/devops-infrastructure.md.
2026-02-13 | Engineering sources guide | research/2026-02-13-engineering-sources-guide.md | Meta-research on highest quality sources by stack layer. Tiered ranking (T1/T2/T3) across frontend, backend, DevOps. Key finding: match source to layer — ByteByteGo for system design, web.dev for web platform, Stripe for API design, CNCF for cloud-native. Official docs before blogs. Surveys for reality, blogs for opinion. Vendor blogs: read details, ignore conclusion. Anti-pattern identification (SEO farms, AI listicles). Topic→source mapping table. Principles extracted to principles/engineering-sources.md.
2026-02-14 | AI/LLM integration best practices | research/2026-02-14-ai-llm-integration-practices.md | Comprehensive survey: architecture patterns (Anthropic's 5 workflow patterns + agents), Vercel AI SDK 6, context engineering (Anthropic's 4 pillars), tool design for agents, MCP, structured output (schema-first), streaming UX (SSE), RAG (hybrid+GraphRAG+SELF-RAG), evaluation (3-tier + CI/CD), cost optimization (multi-layer caching + model routing = 60-80% savings), guardrails (layered by cost), observability (89% adoption), multi-model strategy (37% use 5+ models). Key finding: start simple, earn complexity — evaluation is the biggest gap. Principles extracted to principles/ai-llm-integration.md.
2026-02-14 | Backend & API engineering update | research/2026-02-14-backend-api-practices-update.md | Update to Feb 13 backend research. New sections: AI-agent-ready APIs & MCP protocol stack (A2A/MCP/AG-UI), MCP gateways, Shadow MCP threat. tRPC v11 (FormData, SSE, streaming, HTTP/2). Hono RPC as built-in type safety alternative. Node.js native TypeScript (v23.6+), Permission Model, Undici 7.0. Effect-TS structured concurrency and Effect Cluster. Drizzle MSSQL + consolidated validators. Passkey regulatory deadlines (UAE/India/Philippines/EU). Idempotency patterns (Stripe model). Cloudflare Workers containers + Durable Objects. Security: agentic attack surface, business logic exploits +27%. Principles updated in principles/backend-api-engineering.md (10→16 principles). Feb 13 research marked superseded.
