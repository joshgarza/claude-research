<!-- Sessions will be logged below this line -->
2026-02-11 | OpenClaw low-level integration patterns | research/2026-02-11-openclaw-low-level-patterns.md | First session. Analyzed iMessage monitoring (JSON-RPC subprocess), Swabble wake-word daemon, BlueBubbles webhooks, Signal SSE, WhatsApp Baileys, pairing system, channel abstraction.
2026-02-11 | Frontend UI/UX & branding trends 2026 | research/2026-02-11-frontend-uiux-trends-2026.md | Broad survey across 4 domains: UI/UX visual design, frontend tech (CSS/frameworks), branding/identity, AI-native interfaces (A2UI, generative UI). Key finding: UI is commodity, generative UI is next paradigm.
2026-02-12 | LinkedIn channel integration spec | research/2026-02-12-linkedin-channel-spec.md | High-level spec for OpenClaw LinkedIn channel plugin. Revised to low-frequency polling (1-2x/day) instead of SSE — drops detection risk to near-zero, drastically simplifies architecture. Cron trigger + Voyager REST + state diffing. Cookie-based auth only. SSE documented as upgrade path if real-time ever needed.
2026-02-12 | Termius + tmux scrollback fix | research/2026-02-12-termius-tmux-scrollback.md | Root cause: tmux alternate screen buffer has no native scrollback; Termius (likely xterm.js-based) can't scroll alt buffer. Three-layer problem: alt screen buffer, touch→mouse event translation, xterm.js limitation. Primary fix: keyboard copy mode (Ctrl+b [). Secondary: ensure mouse on + explicit WheelUpPane bindings + update Termius.

Tech stack: Unity, UE5, TypeScript/NestJS/PostgreSQL/GraphQL, Sony mocopi. STAR-format project parallels included.
2026-02-18 | Wedding Venue Finder tech stack overview | research/2026-02-18-wedding-venue-finder-stack.md | Reference snapshot of full e2e stack: React 19 + Vite frontend, Express 5 + TypeScript backend, PostgreSQL 17 with pgvector + PostGIS, Ollama + CLIP for AI/ML, 5-stage data pipeline, Docker Compose (6 services), Vitest testing (223 tests).
2026-02-18 | AWS GameLift deep dive | research/2026-02-18-aws-gamelift-deep-dive.md | Comprehensive research: architecture (FleetIQ, FlexMatch, session management, auto-scaling, scale-to-zero), 3 fleet types (managed EC2, containers, Anywhere), pricing model (Spot 50-90% savings, Anywhere per-session, FlexMatch free with managed), Server SDK 5.x integration flow, 6 competitors analyzed (PlayFab, Photon, Nakama, Agones, Edgegap), strengths (FleetIQ, FlexMatch, 9K servers/min), weaknesses (learning curve, vendor lock-in, debugging, not for persistent worlds), 2025-2026 updates (SDKs open-sourced, OTel built-in, container fleets, scale-to-zero, GameLift Streams launched).
2026-02-19 | [automated] Real-time & Event-Driven Architecture | research/2026-02-19-real-time-event-driven-architecture.md | SSE is default for unidirectional push (~80% of use cases), WebSocket only for bidirectional; scale WS with pub/sub adapters not sticky sessions; event sourcing is specialized (don't apply by default); CQRS Level 1 (same DB) usually sufficient before Level 2; outbox pattern for atomic DB+event publish; TanStack Query isMutating guard for concurrent optimistic updates; broker selection: Redis (ephemeral), NATS (service mesh), Kafka (streaming/replay). 7 principles extracted to principles/real-time-event-driven.md.
2026-02-19 | Research chat widget implementation | PLAN.md | Built dashboard chat widget (Steps 11-13 from roadmap). Backend: Express routes + research service with file listing, queue management, Claude CLI streaming via child_process.spawn. Frontend: ResearchChat module with Chat/Enqueue tabs, file selector with optgroups, SSE streaming, queue status table. Uses Claude subscription via CLI (no API key). Key debugging: stream-json needs --verbose, ~/.claude mount must be read-write, event format is event.message.content not event.text.
2026-02-19 | Perforce Helix Core for game dev | research/2026-02-18-perforce-helix-core-game-dev.md | Complete Git→P4 onboarding reference.

2026-02-22 | WiFi signal strength heatmap app | research/2026-02-22-wifi-heatmap-application.md | Full landscape research for building a WiFi heatmap tool to identify mesh network cold zones. Platform analysis (Tauri 2.0 recommended over Electron, iOS is dead end), WiFi scanning APIs per OS (iw/airport/netsh + Node.js wrappers), IDW interpolation + WebGL rendering (temperature-map-gl, wifi-heatmapper shader approach), click-to-record workflow, mesh node identification via BSSID, mesh APIs (UniFi best, others limited), 5 open-source projects analyzed (wifi-heatmapper by hnykda is best reference — 98.5% TypeScript/Next.js/WebGL). Three build paths: fork wifi-heatmapper, Tauri 2.0 from scratch, or Electron fallback.
2026-02-23 | AI-powered weekly review & daily todo generation | research/2026-02-23-ai-todo-prioritization.md | Landscape research for replacing dashboard WeeklyTodos widget with AI-driven daily focused view. Commercial tools surveyed (Motion, Reclaim, Sunsama, Morgen — none solve the learning agent gap). Teresa Torres's Claude Code + Obsidian approach as closest reference. Key finding: no one has built a weekly review agent with learning profile. Recommended Option A: dashboard-native with weekly review chat + daily todo widget + YAML learning profile in vault. Also documented obsidian-tasks-mcp and Local REST API plugin options. Architecture, interview framework, and daily plan format specified.
2026-02-23 | Multi-modal venue recommendation engine | research/2026-02-23-multi-modal-venue-recommendation-engine.md | Recommendation engine for wedding venue finder. Existing stack: ViT-B/32 CLIP (512d), pgvector, per-photo venue embeddings already stored. Architecture decisions: multi-vector venues (keep individual photos), k-means with silhouette auto-detect for Pinterest taste clusters (2-5), weighted MaxSim scoring (ColBERT-inspired), nomic-embed-text locally for text (summarize-then-embed, not CLIP text encoder), migrate taste_profiles → taste_clusters table. UX shift: scrapping swipe in favor of Pinterest-import + LLM-based conversational filtering. Implicit learning deferred to post-v1. Key references: PinnerSage (KDD 2020), ItemSage (KDD 2022), ColBERT MaxSim, Stitch Fix, The Knot.
2026-02-23 | Pinterest API v5 integration research | research/2026-02-23-pinterest-api-v5-integration.md | Full API surface research for wedding venue finder Pinterest import. OAuth 2.0 auth code flow (30-day tokens, 1-year refresh), scopes (boards:read, pins:read, user_accounts:read), business account required for app dev. Pin response includes 4 image sizes (150x150, 400x300, 600x, originals) on i.pinimg.com CDN — no auth needed to download, no URL expiration. Bookmark-based pagination (page_size default 25, max 100-250). Board sections: GET /boards/{board_id}/pins likely returns all pins including sectioned. Trial access: daily rate limits, 24hr test tokens. Standard access: requires recorded demo with full OAuth flow — common rejection reasons documented. Alternative approaches evaluated (RSS dead, scraping bad, official API is right path).
2026-02-23 | Cold start strategies for small Pinterest boards | research/2026-02-23-cold-start-small-pinterest-boards.md | Addresses clustering breakdown when users have <10 pins. Key findings: k-means is meaningless below 5 points, silhouette score unreliable below 15. Tiered strategy: 0 pins = popularity + style quiz, 1-4 = individual pin queries + MMR diversity re-ranking, 5-15 = validated k=2 with fallback, 16+ = full pipeline. Pre-defined archetype classification (10 wedding styles via CLIP zero-shot) works at any board size for free. LLM style inference ($0.01-0.05/user) augments sparse profiles. Stitch Fix's visual self-selection validated over verbal self-description. Pinterest's "Warmer for Less" (2025) paper: manifold mixup + score regularization for cold items. Progressive profiling via LLM conversation is the refinement mechanism. Graceful degradation: communicate uncertainty as invitation to provide more signal, not as disclaimer.
2026-02-23 | Conversational search to SQL filters + vector re-ranking | research/2026-02-23-conversational-search-to-sql-vector-reranking.md | How to translate LLM conversations into SQL WHERE clauses + vector query adjustments for wedding venue recommendation. Key findings: (1) Full NL2SQL is overkill for fixed schema — use function calling / structured output to extract typed filter params. (2) Full filter state per turn, not diffs — LLM returns complete new state each time. (3) CTE pre-filter then vector rank at small scale; pgvector 0.8 iterative scan (relaxed_order, up to 5.7x faster) at scale. (4) Nomic Embed Vision v1.5 shares latent space with nomic-embed-text — future migration enables unified text-to-image cross-modal queries. (5) Text aesthetic queries embedded with nomic as additional vector signal alongside taste clusters. (6) Production validation: Zillow, Airbnb (Feb 2026), Realtor.com all use NL→structured filter extraction, not NL2SQL. Vercel AI SDK 6 streamText + tools is the implementation framework. 6 principles extracted.
2026-02-23 | Recommendation engine principles extraction | principles/recommendation-engine.md | Consolidated 17 principles from 4 research files (multi-modal venue recommendation, Pinterest API v5, cold start strategies, conversational search). Categories: venue representation (multi-vector), taste modeling (clustering + archetypes), MaxSim scoring, summarize-then-embed, function calling over NL2SQL, full state per turn, pgvector operations (CTE pre-filter, iterative scan, index thresholds), Pinterest integration (batch pipeline, app approval), cold start (tiered degradation, visual self-selection, progressive profiling via conversation).
2026-02-23 | AI coding agents + Linear ticket workflows | research/2026-02-23-ai-agent-linear-ticket-workflows.md | Comprehensive landscape research: Linear's Agent API (Developer Preview, AgentSession lifecycle, 5 activity types, 10s webhook timeout), 15+ agents in Linear marketplace (Copilot, Devin, Cursor, Codegen, Cyrus, Warp/Oz), MCP servers (official remote + 4 community), orchestration platforms (Cyrus, claude-code-connect boss/worker, CCPM PRD->parallel agents, agenttools/worktree), GitHub Actions sync patterns, 4 multi-agent patterns (coordinator/worker, spec-driven pipeline, PRD->parallel, label trigger), best practices (spec-first, hard gates, worktree isolation, atomic tickets, progressive trust).
2026-02-23 | AI agent orchestration via ticket/task systems | research/2026-02-23-ai-agent-ticket-orchestration.md | Broad landscape research across 6 dimensions: (1) swarm patterns (hierarchical, shared board, mesh, progressive autonomy), (2) Claude Code Teams architecture (7 primitives, TaskList polling, SendMessage, spawn backends), (3) TODO alternatives (flat files → Beads SQLite+JSONL → GitHub Issues → Linear → native TaskList), (4) ticket decomposition (3-5 subtasks/level, contract-first, DAG dependencies, CrewAI task model), (5) event-driven pipelines (webhook → agent → PR for Copilot/Codex/Cyrus/Port.io), (6) open-source frameworks (Beads, claude-flow, CCPM, Cyrus, Open SWE, LangGraph, CrewAI, Conductor). 11 principles extracted to principles/agent-task-orchestration.md.
2026-02-23 | AI agent + Jira/Trello ticket management integration | research/2026-02-23-ai-agent-ticket-management-integration.md | Landscape research on integrating AI coding agents with project management tools. 3 tiers of Jira MCP servers (official Atlassian OAuth, mcp-atlassian Python, tom28881 TypeScript with 22+ tools). 4 Trello MCP servers (delorenj best). 3 ticket-to-PR patterns (Port.io orchestration, OpenAI Codex cookbook with GitHub Actions, Claude Code headless). 4 autonomous systems (Anabranch 5-stage pipeline, Devin native Jira, deepsense AI Teammate, Rovo Dev). Multi-agent: Claude Code experimental agent teams, claude-flow, ccswarm. CI: Atlassian gajira suite for bidirectional sync. No tool does full human-out-of-loop yet — all require PR review gate.
2026-02-24 | SkillsBench: benchmarking agent Skills across tasks | research/2026-02-24-arxiv-2602-12670.md | arXiv paper analysis (2602.12670). First systematic benchmark for Agent Skills (structured procedural knowledge). 84 tasks, 11 domains, 7 frontier models, 3 harnesses, 7,308 trajectories. Key findings: curated Skills +16.2pp avg (Healthcare +51.9pp, SWE +4.5pp — gaps drive gains), self-generated Skills useless (-1.3pp), 2-3 focused Skills optimal (comprehensive docs harmful at -2.9pp), smaller models + Skills match larger models without, harness architecture mediates utilization (Codex CLI ignores Skills, Claude Code uses them).
2026-02-24 | Evaluating AGENTS.md context files for coding agents | research/2026-02-24-arxiv-2602-11988.md | arxiv:2602.11988 paper analysis. ETH Zurich/DeepCode study: LLM-generated context files (AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md) reduce task success rates while increasing inference costs 20%+. Developer-written files marginally better (+4%) but inconsistent. Root cause: over-specification — agents follow unnecessary instructions that make tasks harder. Key recommendation: minimal, requirement-focused context files only. Novel benchmark: AGENTbench (138 instances, 12 repos with real context files). Tested Claude Code + Sonnet 4.5, Codex + GPT-5.2/5.1 mini, Qwen Code. Directly relevant to our CLAUDE.md design.
2026-02-24 | Agent context augmentation research landscape | research/2026-02-24-agent-context-augmentation-landscape.md | Comprehensive deep-dive survey across 25+ papers, 6 industry blog posts, and community discussions. Covers: context files (AGENTS.md effectiveness, adoption, maintenance), instruction following (150-line threshold, degradation patterns, agent drift), context retrieval (ContextBench, SWE Context Bench), skills architecture (scaling limits at 50-100 skills, security: 26.1% vulnerable), context management (masking > summarization, context rot), industry practices (Anthropic, OpenAI, Spotify, Vercel, Manus, Cursor, Windsurf). Key convergence: less is more (universal), LLM-generated context fails (universal), focused human-authored augmentation is the only approach that reliably helps. 10 principles extracted to principles/agent-context-augmentation.md.
2026-02-24 | [automated] Appsec security tooling uses in agentic engineering | research/2026-02-24-appsec-security-tooling-uses-in-agentic-engineering.md | OWASP Agentic Top 10 (ASI01-ASI10), 3-layer security model (pre-generation context, in-flow MCP scanning, CI/CD gates), open-source tooling landscape (Semgrep MCP server, Opengrep, CodeQL, Bearer, OWASP ZAP, Nuclei, Gitleaks, TruffleHog, Socket.dev, Trivy, claude-code-owasp skill), OpenSSF guide for AI code assistants, Rules File Backdoor attack, MCP security threats. Key finding: deterministic enforcement (hooks/CI) over prompt-based security — "act as security expert" actually increases vulnerabilities. 5 principles added to principles/security.md (12→17).
2026-02-24 | [automated] Resolve.ai | research/2026-02-24-resolve-ai.md | Autonomous AI SRE platform by ex-Splunk/OpenTelemetry founders. $160M raised, $1B valuation. Multi-agent parallel hypothesis investigation for production incidents. Named customers: Coinbase (73% faster RCA), DoorDash (87% faster investigations), Zscaler (30% fewer engineers/incident). Live knowledge graph + RAG + policy-aware agents. Human-on-the-loop positioning — 80% alert auto-resolution target. Competes with Datadog Bits AI, PagerDuty SRE Agent. OTel-native approach hedges vendor lock-in.
2026-02-24 | [automated] Migration & Legacy Modernization | research/2026-02-24-migration-legacy-modernization.md | Strangler Fig pattern (7-step impl, proxy-first, ACL, pitfalls: adapter hell + perpetual hybrid), big bang vs incremental analysis, 6-stage migration flag model (off→dualwrite→shadow→live→rampdown→complete), shadow mode testing, CDC over bulk migration, feature parity trap (50% unused features, track outcomes not features), Event Storming for seam identification, Leave-and-Layer for COTS, expand/contract for schema, DORA metrics baseline. 11 principles extracted to principles/migration-legacy-modernization.md (new file).
2026-02-24 | [automated] Overstory | research/2026-02-24-overstory.md | Jayminwest's project-agnostic Claude Code swarm CLI (v0.6.4, TypeScript/Bun). Architecture: interactive session IS the orchestrator, 3-tier hierarchy (coordinator→lead→leaf workers), PreToolUse hooks for mechanical role enforcement, SQLite WAL mail system (~1-5ms), 4-tier merge conflict resolution, tiered watchdog monitoring. Key differentiation: only project with mechanical hook enforcement and comprehensive observability (TUI, cost tracking, trace/replay). STEELMAN.md documents honest critique: 20-agent swarm costs $60 vs $9 sequential, compounding errors, debugging forensics. Ecosystem: Beads/Seeds task tracker abstraction, Mulch expertise persistence, Canopy prompt composition. 3 new principles added to principles/agent-task-orchestration.md (11→14).
2026-02-24 | Claude Code headless permissions & guardrails | research/2026-02-24-claude-code-headless-permissions-guardrails.md | Comprehensive reference for running Claude Code in headless/automated mode. 5 permission modes (default/acceptEdits/plan/dontAsk/bypassPermissions), --dangerously-skip-permissions + --allow-dangerously-skip-permissions, --allowedTools/--disallowedTools/--tools CLI flags, settings.json permission rules (deny→ask→allow evaluation), complete hooks system (18 events, 3 hook types: command/prompt/agent, PreToolUse allow/deny/ask decisions), --max-turns + --max-budget-usd as emergency brakes, native sandboxing (bubblewrap/seatbelt, 84% prompt reduction), devcontainer reference architecture, GitHub Actions claude-code-action@v1, OTel monitoring. Key patterns: progressive trust escalation, spec-first reduces blast radius, deterministic hooks > prompt-based safety.
2026-02-24 | [automated] VLM basics | research/2026-02-24-vlm-basics.md | How VLMs work: ViT vision encoder (image→patches→tokens), projection layer (768d→4096d MLP adapter), LLM backbone. CLIP/SigLIP as universal visual foundation. Three-stage training (contrastive pretraining→projector alignment→SFT). Token budget is key constraint (224px image→256 tokens; dynamic tiling→2000+). Key failure modes: hallucination (benchmark with POPE/MMHal-Bench), spatial reasoning, counting. Model selection: CLIP for retrieval, full VLM for generation; Qwen2.5-VL/InternVL3 for open-source production; SmolVLM2 for edge. 8 principles extracted to principles/vlm-basics.md (new file).
2026-02-24 | [automated] Frievalds Algorithm | research/2026-02-24-frievalds-algorithm.md | Freivalds' (1977) randomized matrix multiplication verifier: O(kn²) vs O(n^2.373+) deterministic. One-sided error (no false negatives, ≤2^{-k} false positives after k rounds). Proof via Schwartz-Zippel lemma. Fingerprinting framework unifies Freivalds with polynomial identity testing, Reed-Solomon codes, communication complexity. Gaussian variant (GVFA) for floating-point/HPC. Applications: outsourced computation verification, ZK proofs, compiler optimization, distributed equality testing. 7 principles extracted to principles/randomized-algorithms.md (new file).
2026-02-24 | [automated] Five whys | research/2026-02-24-five-whys.md | Origin: Sakichi Toyoda/Toyota 1930s, formalized by Taiichi Ohno. Process: 7 steps from precise problem statement to monitored countermeasure. Key principles: "human error" is never a root cause; stop at systemic countermeasures not symptoms; WYLFIWYF bias; linearity limitation for complex systems (Salesforce Engineering "How not Why"). Fishbone+5Whys hybrid for multi-cause failures. Software applications: incident postmortems (SRE), agile retros. Emerging: LLM-assisted RCA (FSE 2024, AIOps 2025). 4 principles added to principles/team-process-practices.md.
2026-02-24 | [automated] Team & Process Practices | research/2026-02-24-team-process-practices.md | Code review (Google's code health standard, < 400 LOC / < 24h targets, automate style so humans focus on architecture), ADRs (one per significant decision, Nygard/MADR templates, store in git), technical debt (Fowler quadrant, SonarQube enforcement + CodeScene strategy, 20% sprint allocation), on-call (max 2 incidents/12h, quiet time → observability improvements, runbook ownership, blameless postmortems), documentation (Diátaxis 4-type framework, docs-as-code in git). 15 principles extracted to principles/team-process-practices.md (new file).
2026-02-24 | [automated] GameLift | research/2026-02-24-gamelift.md | Interview-context supplement to 02-18 deep dive. Netflix cloud gaming connection (Squid Game: Unleashed on GameLift, GameLift Streams for TV distribution, Netflix FIFA likely same stack), physics-based multiplayer networking (UE5 resimulation mode, Unity Netcode prediction, tick rate/CPU tradeoffs), engine-specific integration paths (Unity C# SDK 5.x, UE5 plugin with CloudFormation), FlexMatch sports game rule sets with expansions, persistent world pattern for Journeyman, local→cloud dev workflow, cost modeling (~$7-8K/month at 5K DAU with Spot), competitive analysis for Refactor Games' specific needs.
2026-02-24 | [automated] Search, Analytics & Product Observability | research/2026-02-24-search-analytics-product-observability.md | Typesense (C++ RAM-based HA) vs Meilisearch (Rust single-node simple) vs Elasticsearch (log analytics only) decision framework; event taxonomy (Noun+Past-Tense Verb, snake_case, compact 50-100 events); hybrid client+server tracking; PostHog as SMB default (ClickHouse, all-in-one); A/B testing: feature flags=deployment, A/B tests=measurement, CUPED+sequential testing 2x faster experiments; Statsig as best stats engine; warehouse as single source of truth; OTel custom instruments for business metrics alongside infrastructure golden signals. 10 principles extracted to principles/search-analytics-observability.md (new file).
2026-02-24 | [automated] Research this site (CodeScene agentic AI patterns) | research/2026-02-24-research-this-site.md | Adam Tornhill/CodeScene's 6 operational patterns for agentic AI coding. Key findings: 30%+ defect risk increase in unhealthy code (peer-reviewed, arxiv:2601.02200), Code Health 9.5+ threshold before agent deployment, three-tier quality gates (continuous/pre-commit/PR), AGENTS.md workflow gates need objective metrics not vague instructions, human-written tests + coverage enforcement prevent agent test deletion, loveholidays case study (0→50% agent-assisted in 5 months). 4 new principles added to principles/ai-tool-adoption.md (12→16).
2026-02-24 | [automated] DDS Data Cartridge as a lofi backup option | research/2026-02-24-dds-data-cartridge-as-a-lofi-backup-option.md | DDS/DAT is a dead format (160GB max, media supply ending, Gen 8 cancelled). Compelling air-gap/lofi appeal but too capacity-constrained for modern use. DAT-72 USB drives ($30-75 used) work plug-and-play on Linux with tar+mt. For new tape investment, LTO-6/7/8 used is the only viable path. HDD rotation is simpler for personal <20TB backup. Format verdict: DDS is recovery-only territory in 2026, not new-investment territory.
2026-02-24 | [automated] Claude released static cofe analysis | research/2026-02-24-claude-released-static-cofe-analysis.md | Anthropic's Claude Code Security (Feb 20 2026): reasoning-based AI vulnerability scanner embedded in Claude Code. Uses Opus 4.6. Found 500+ zero-days in Ghostscript/OpenSC/CGIF via data flow tracing and commit history analysis. Key distinction: discovery tool (periodic deep scans) not enforcement tool (CI gates). 86% false positive rate in benchmarks. Cannot detect business logic or runtime bugs. Complements not replaces Semgrep/CodeQL. Triggered 8-10% drops in CrowdStrike/Cloudflare stock. New principle added to principles/security.md.
2026-02-24 | [automated] Zeropath | research/2026-02-24-zeropath.md | ZeroPath is an LLM-native SAST platform ($60/contributor/mo) using tree-sitter AST + Tree-of-Thoughts reasoning to find business logic vulnerabilities (87.5% detection vs 12% Semgrep) that rule-based tools miss. Validated: ~170 bugs found in curl despite existing Coverity/CodeQL/scan-build coverage. Zero-days in Netflix/Hulu/Salesforce. Technical vulns: 80% detection, 25% FPR. Also acts as SAST enhancement layer over Semgrep/Snyk. Fits as 4th layer in agentic security stack. New LLM-native SAST principle added to principles/security.md.
2026-02-24 | [automated] La Pavoni | research/2026-02-24-la-pavoni.md | Italian lever espresso machine brand founded 1905. Europiccola (800ml boiler) vs Professional (1.6L boiler) — identical shot quality, differs in capacity. Technique-dependent: temperature surfing, pre-infusion, manual pressure control. 2026 models standardized to brass pistons + 52mm portafilters. Best grinder pairing: Niche Zero (mid-range). Key maintenance: descale regularly, avoid citric acid in group head (chrome lining). Lever espresso is softer/sweeter than pump; high skill ceiling but supreme control.
2026-02-24 | [automated] Blue Screen of Death: FAULTY_HARDWARE_CORRUPTED_PAGE | research/2026-02-24-blue-screen-of-death-faulty-hardware-corrupted-page.md | Stop code 0x0000012B = physical memory corruption (hardware access). Two scenarios: params 3+4=0 (single-bit RAM error) vs non-zero (Compressed Store failure). Primary fix path: read crash dumps with BlueScreenView → disable XMP/DOCP → run MemTest86 (4+ passes) → test RAM sticks individually → reseat RAM → update IMEI/chipset/GPU drivers → update BIOS → SFC/DISM/chkdsk. Any single MemTest86 error = RAM defective. XMP instability is high-probability cause for modern builds.
2026-02-24 | [automated] Wezterm | research/2026-02-24-wezterm.md | GPU-accelerated Rust terminal with built-in multiplexer and first-class WSL2 domain support. Best cross-platform terminal for WSL2 on Windows in 2026 (Ghostty lacks native Windows support). Key advantages: WslDomain auto-detection, shell integration for cwd tracking, single Lua config across all OSes, built-in panes/workspaces (no tmux needed). Drawbacks: Lua learning curve, slower release cadence since 2024 (solo maintainer), ~200MB binary. Recommend switching from Windows Terminal for serious WSL development.
2026-02-24 | [automated] Deterministic fault injection | research/2026-02-24-determinisitic-fault-injection.md | Seed-driven fault injection that makes failures reproducible. Key pattern: seed a PRNG at test start, route all random decisions through it, log seed on failure. Case studies: Dropbox Nucleus (CanopyCheck + Trinity, 10M seeds/night), TigerBeetle VOPR (whole cluster in single thread at 1000x speed, safety+liveness split), FoundationDB BUGGIFY macro (fault injection in production binary, simulation-only), SQLite (exhaustive N-th I/O fail iteration → 100% branch coverage), WarpStream+Antithesis (found microsecond data-loss race in 233s that 10K hours standard testing missed). Core architecture: single-process simulation + simulated time + seeded PRNG + mocked I/O + BUGGIFY-style cooperative annotations. 4 principles added to principles/testing-strategy.md.
2026-02-25 | [automated] Queue for agent orchestration | research/2026-02-25-queue-for-agent-orchestration.md | Comprehensive survey of queue architectures for controlling agent concurrency. Three levels: in-process semaphore (zero deps), BullMQ+Redis (persistent multi-process), Temporal/Trigger.dev (durable execution for long-running workflows). Rate limiting: token bucket recommended (prevents ~40% API cost waste), circuit breaker via cockatiel after 5 consecutive 429s. Anthropic Batch API: 50% cost savings, up to 10K messages, ideal for non-interactive overnight research. Cross-repo: domain-partitioned queues (separate queue per project type) + git worktrees for isolation. CPU guidance: Claude agents = CPU-intensive, cap concurrency at num_cpu_cores (1-2 on dev, 4-8 in CI). 4 principles added to principles/agent-task-orchestration.md (14→18).
2026-02-25 | [automated] Agent harnesses | research/2026-02-25-agent-harnesses.md | Harness = batteries-included infrastructure layer above framework/runtime: context management, tool orchestration, error recovery, state persistence, human-in-the-loop, lifecycle hooks, sub-agents. OS analogy: model=CPU, context=RAM, harness=OS, agent=app. Key findings: harness selection mediates whether Skills/context augmentation works (SkillsBench: Claude Code uses Skills, Codex CLI ignores them); fewer general-purpose tools outperform many specialized ones (Vercel 15→2 tools: 80%→100% accuracy, 37% fewer tokens, 3.5x faster); Initializer+Coder pattern for multi-session continuity; Manus rebuilt harness 5x in 6 months, acquired by Meta ~$2B. Anthropic Claude Agent SDK is canonical reference harness. 4 principles added to principles/agent-task-orchestration.md (18→22).
2026-02-25 | [automated] Opinion piece on LLMs in production | research/2026-02-25-opinion-piece-on-llms-in-production.md | Review of Obong's "Writing High Quality Production Code with LLMs is a Solved Problem" (Senior Engineer, Airbnb). Agrees on SDD methodology (Conversation→Spec→Atomic Tasks→Execute) and cognitive leverage framing. Challenges "solved" claim: METR RCT shows 19% net slowdown for experienced devs (July 2025), Veracode 45% AI code vulnerability rate, comprehension debt compounding at team scale. Settled consensus: AI as productivity multiplier for disciplined senior engineers; security requires systematic SAST; team-scale requires shared infrastructure. 5 principles added to principles/ai-tool-adoption.md (16→21).
2026-02-26 | [automated] Tmux workflows for agentic engineering | research/2026-02-26-tmux-workflows.md | Claude Code hooks as integration layer (14 events), emoji-prefixed window state machines (🤖/⚡/💬), clickable notifications with pane-jump via stored WS_TMUX_LOCATION env var, AI-generated window names via capture-pane polling, worktree+window as atomic unit of parallel work, `claude --worktree --tmux` built-in, agent monitoring tools (Agent Deck, ATM, workmux), uzi CLI for parallel spawning, hierarchical named-session agent systems. 9 principles extracted to principles/terminal-tmux-agentic.md (new file).

Convergent thesis: diversity > hand-coded inductive biases; emergent meta-learning from sequence models; program-as-genome evolutionary search. 6 principles extracted to principles/ai-learning-mechanisms.md (new file).
2026-02-26 | [automated] Idea: chatbot with human in the loop context management | research/2026-02-26-idea-chatbot-with-human-in-the-loop-context-management.md | Context rot and loss-in-the-middle are well-documented; current tools (Claude compact, Cursor /summarize) are opaque and automatic. The idea — user-facing interactive review at compaction time — is not implemented in any major product. Anthropic's pause_after_compaction is the exact API primitive needed. JetBrains NeurIPS 2025: masking tool outputs ≈ summarization in quality, 50% cheaper. Three-tier heuristic: keep recent turns verbatim, summarize old turns, mask/drop tool outputs. No principles extracted — this is an unvalidated product idea.
2026-02-26 | [automated] Free day — Conway's Game of Life as a universal computer | research/2026-02-26-free-day.md | Three rules → gliders → logic gates → Turing machines (2001) → OTCA metapixel/Life-in-Life (2006) → 0E0P self-replicating metacell (2018) → Tetris (2017, ~29B cells, QFTASM+COGOL stack) → Lisp interpreter (2022, ~35T generations). Hashlife quadtree algorithm enables simulation. Philosophical connection to digital physics (Zuse/Fredkin/Wheeler "It from Bit"). No principles extracted — exploratory/philosophical research.
2026-02-26 | [automated] Free day — Optimal Stopping Theory and the 37% Rule | research/2026-02-26-free-day-2.md | Secretary problem / look-then-leap framework. Optimal threshold = n/e ≈ 37%, success probability = 1/e. Mathematical proof via backward induction. Variants: full-information (Moser), recall-allowed (threshold→61%), house-selling (reservation price), parking. Odds Algorithm (Bruss 2000). Prophet inequality (Krengel-Sucheston 1978, competitive ratio 1/2). Gittins Index for multi-armed bandits. Ski rental as online algorithm cousin. Empirical validation confirmed. Key failure modes: unknown n, recall possible, humans systematically stop too early. No principles extracted — exploratory/philosophical research.
2026-02-27 | [automated] The Winning Lottery Ticket | research/2026-02-27-the-winning-lottery-ticket.md | Fact-checked MIT's "delete 90% of a neural network" claim: verified on small/medium vision models (LeNet, Conv-2/4/6, VGG-19) via iterative magnitude pruning + weight rewinding. Winning tickets are 10-20% of original size, learn faster, generalize better. Hypothesis weakens at scale (requires late rewinding, not init). Hardware gap: 90% unstructured sparsity yields only 1.2-2x GPU speedup; NVIDIA 2:4 structured sparsity gives real 2x at 50%. Frankle (MIT PhD '23) co-founded MosaicML, acquired by Databricks for $1.3B. LTH inspired but doesn't directly apply to modern LLM pruning (SparseGPT, Wanda use different methods).
2026-02-28 | [automated] Zero knowledge proofs in regards to large language models | research/2026-02-28-research-zero-knowledge-proofs-in-regards-to-large-language-models.md | Two directions: ZKPs applied to LLMs (zkML) for verifiable/private inference; LLMs applied to ZKP (ZK-Coder) for circuit code generation. Key findings: GPT-2 provable in production (DeepProve-1), 13B model in <15 min (zkLLM CCS 2024), ZK-DeepSeek (671B) technically possible but hours per operation, VeriLoRA for fine-tuning verification, 10,000-100,000x overhead vs. plain inference. Governance use cases (model provenance, compliance, training data attestation) are the practical entry point. Optimistic zkML pattern emerging. 7 principles extracted to principles/zkml-verifiable-ai.md (new file).
2026-02-28 | [automated] Research the best way to pet cats. | research/2026-02-28-research-the-best-way-to-pet-cats.md | CAT framework (Choice/Control, Attention, Touch on facial regions) reduces cat aggression from 27% to 16% and increases affiliative behavior (Nottingham Trent / Frontiers in Veterinary Science 2021). Preferred zones: cheeks, chin, forehead, base of ears (scent gland regions). Consent test: offer finger, wait for cat to initiate — sniffing alone is not consent. Overstimulation signals: tail swishing, skin rippling, ear flattening. End sessions while cat still enjoys them. Individual variation is the authoritative rule. 6 principles extracted to principles/cat-petting.md (new file).
2026-02-28 | [automated] Investigate the folder-tree memory system approach for Claude Code seen in a video, which uses a /memory skill and organizes memory in a tree of folders. | research/2026-02-28-investigate-the-folder-tree-memory-system-approach-for-claude-code-seen-in-a-video-which-uses-a-memory-skill-and-organizes-memory-in-a-tree-of-folders.md | Official auto-memory: MEMORY.md index (200-line limit, always loaded) + on-demand topic files at ~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/. Built-in /memory command (not a custom skill) toggles auto-memory and opens file selector. Key pattern: Cline Memory Bank methodology (6 hierarchical files: projectbrief/productContext/systemPatterns/techContext/activeContext/progress). Claude Code adaptations: hudrazine, boyte, centminmod repos. Community skills: SpillwaveSolutions/project-memory (docs/project_notes/ with bugs/decisions/key_facts/issues). Advanced: Claude Cognitive HOT/WARM/COLD attention-based loading (64-95% token reduction). 3 principles added to principles/agent-context-augmentation.md (10->13).
